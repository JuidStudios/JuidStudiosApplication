# JuidStudiosApplications

This is where you can manually get our programs. You will notice that there are only the install files. To access the source code, please either pay for one file or purchase the JuidLucent membership. View our pricings at juidstudios.com.

These files will install a program into your computer so that you can run it easily. So far, JuidStudios only supports windows user with problems as such. Mac support is on the way.

As this is free, you have permission to share these files with others but do not pass this as if you made it. Tell them where you got it please.
You may not share the source files.
